# Zero-shot Segment Anything example

This example demonstrates how to use a Python API implementation of Zero-shot Segment Anything pipeline inference:

- Create encoder and decoder models
- Create a zero-shot visual prompter pipeline
- Use points as prompts to learn on one image
- Segment other image using leaned on the previous image representation
- Visualized result is saved to `zsl_sam_result.jpg`

## Prerequisites

Install Model API from source. Please refer to the main [README](../../../README.md) for details.

## Run example

To run the example, please execute the following command:

```bash
python run.py <path_to_source_image> <path_to_target_image> <encoder_path> <decoder_path> <prompts> -t <mask confidence threshold>
```

where prompts are in X Y format. `t` is a threshold to match the reference features from the source image vs features
obtained from the target image.
Higher thresholds leads to lower mask recall in the final prediction, i.e. low confidence masks can be filtered.

To run the pipeline out-of-the box you can download the test data by running the following command from the repo root:

```bash
pip install httpx
python tests/python/accuracy/prepare_data.py -d data
```

and then run

```bash
python run.py ../../../data/coco128/images/train2017/000000000025.jpg \
     ../../../data/coco128/images/train2017/000000000072.jpg ../../../data/otx_models/sam_vit_b_zsl_encoder.xml \
     ../../../data/otx_models/sam_vit_b_zsl_decoder.xml 464 202 -t 0.7

```

from the sample folder. Here one prompt is passed via CLI: `(464 202)`

> _NOTE_: results of segmentation models are saved to `zsl_sam_result.jpg` file.
